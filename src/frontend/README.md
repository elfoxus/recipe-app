# Frontend

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.3.4.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.
Shortly, you can use `ng g c component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use schematics with the use of IntelliJ IDEA menu.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

By default Angular uses Karma tests, but since they're deprecated, this project switched over to Jest, which is a more modern and faster testing framework.
We will keep on using Jest for testing purposes of frontend code.

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Jest](https://jestjs.io/).
The tests will run withouth watch mode by default. To run tests in watch mode, use `npm run test:watch`.
You can also run tests with coverage report by using `npm run test:coverage`.

## Running end-to-end tests (currently not implemented)

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
